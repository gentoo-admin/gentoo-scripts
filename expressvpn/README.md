README.md

Scripts to install and run the ExpressVPN client on Gentoo Linux (OpenRC).
As of 2020 Gentoo not officially supported by ExpressVPN, however has been ran successfully since 2017 :)

./upgrade-expressvpn.sh will download, extract and compare content of the new and prev .deb packages, then generate a default ebuild. In most cases no manual adjustment is needed for the generated ebuild.
